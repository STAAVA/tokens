# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
bunx hardhat help
bunx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true bunx hardhat test
bunx hardhat node
bunx hardhat run scripts/deploy-subnet-tokens.ts
bunx hardhat run scripts/deploySQN.ts
...
```
